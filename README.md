# ELEC 4700 Waveguide mode solving

## Observations

- Surf and contour ultimately convey the same information, but the colormap of surf is indicates where the power is very intuitively 
- As the ridge gets more narrow, the effective refractive index decreases. As the ridge decreases in size light will reflect more as it moves through the waveguide, increasing the delay per unit length
- As the grid size is decreased, we lose granularity in the mode plots as well as precision in the effective refractive index
- As the refractive index of the ridge is decreased, the effective refractive index is decreased, and less power is transferred through the ridge.
